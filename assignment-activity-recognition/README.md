# Activity Recognition 

The data/dataset.csv is downloaded from Kaggle, and has been analyzed and visualized on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vmalyi/run-or-walk-data-analysis-and-visualization), considered as a high quality dataset for run-walk activity recognition.

The assignment we need to do is more than that, we need to classify standing, walking or running. And we need to clean the data first, in order to be used for training.
